# CdTitles
Repository of cdtitles for Stepmania

This is a repo that tries to preserve cd titles from original DDR games and some custom created from the related series of games/music. They are in Regular size (128x80) and Double resolution (256x160) for HD SM5 themes. You could create pull requests if you wanna contribute something, or send me a PM in Zenius.
